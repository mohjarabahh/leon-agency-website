<h1 align='center'>Leon Agency Website</h1>

A digital agency landing page developed using HTML and CSS, built by converting a PSD web template made by [Graphberry](https://www.graphberry.com/item/leon-psd-agency-template) into a usable and responsive website. It comes in a modern and flat design with vibrant colors. This landing page is great for representing a portfolio for a digital agency. This project has been finished while learning HTML and CSS from [Osama Elzero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osamaelzero) at [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/@ElzeroWebSchool).
